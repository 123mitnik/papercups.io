# <Link href="/blog/story"><a>Lessons from the Launch</a></Link>

_By Kam Leung · September 14, 2020_

We launched Papercups on Hacker News recently.  In the YC community the Hacker News launch is a rite of passage following in the footsteps of companies like Dropbox and Gitlab. Originally we were worried about how it would be received but at the same time was excited about being able to show our product to a lot of like minded developers. We were very grateful for the feedback and wanted to share what we did and the lessons that we have learned.

# <Link href="/blog/story"><a>Our Story</a></Link>

_By Alex Reichert · August 10, 2020_

Kam and I met in SF around 6 years ago, and have been hacking on small projects together for the past couple years. Before Covid, we would spend many Sunday afternoons in coffee shops building prototypes of whatever our latest and greatest idea was… most of these fizzled out after a few weeks or so.
